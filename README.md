# Semi-supervised Hedge Fund Clustering

This repository presents a semi-supervised clustering algorithm for fund of fund analysis. It utilised hierchical fund classifications provided by data vendors and some of the known true classifications based on due diligence.

Based on my two other repo, [AKB-distance](https://github.com/hon-gyu/hierarchical-tree-distance) and [semi-supervised-chameleon-clustering](https://github.com/hon-gyu/semi-supervised-chameleon-clustering).
